# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: Implement WebSockets for Real-Time Synchronization of Game State

### **Context**
During early development of the **Incognito Game**, we noticed a significant issue: the web pages for each player were not staying synchronized in real-time. Players performing actions such as voting, starting rounds, or eliminating others did not see immediate updates reflected on other players’ browsers. Initially, the game relied on standard HTTP request-response cycles which require explicit page reloads or polling to update state, resulting in delayed or inconsistent game views.

To provide a seamless, interactive multiplayer experience with minimal latency, we decided to implement **WebSockets** to enable persistent, bidirectional communication channels between the server and clients.

### **Decision**
We will use **WebSockets** via **Socket.IO** to enable real-time communication and synchronization between the server and all connected clients during gameplay.

### **What WebSockets Enable Us To Do**
- **Real-Time Updates**: Push game state changes (e.g., votes cast, player eliminations, round starts, game endings) instantly to all connected players without page reloads.
- **Bidirectional Communication**: Allow clients to send messages to the server and receive immediate responses or broadcasts.
- **Room-Based Events**: Organize players into rooms (based on game code) so events are scoped to relevant players only.
- **Reduced Latency**: Unlike polling, WebSockets keep a constant connection, reducing network overhead and delay.
- **Better User Experience**: Players see the current game state live, making gameplay engaging and fluid.

### **Advantages**
- **Instant Synchronization**: All players receive updates simultaneously, ensuring consistent and up-to-date game state views.
- **Efficient Communication**: Maintains a single open connection, reducing the need for repeated HTTP requests and server load.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Facilitates clean, modular code by reacting to discrete events like ‘playerJoined’, ‘voteSubmitted’, or ‘gameEnded’.
- **Scalability**: Socket rooms allow scaling by isolating game-specific communications, avoiding broadcast storms.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Supported by most modern browsers and platforms, enabling wide accessibility.

### **Disadvantages**
- **Increased Complexity**: Adds an asynchronous event-driven layer, requiring careful management of socket connections and state synchronization.
- **Connection Management**: Handling client disconnects, reconnections, and edge cases can be challenging.
- **Debugging Difficulty**: Asynchronous and event-based systems have been harder to debug compared to synchronous HTTP.
- **Initial Learning Curve**: Team must gain proficiency with Socket.IO and real-time programming concepts.

### **Why Switch to WebSockets Now?**
- **Core Gameplay Needs**: Real-time player interactions are critical for a responsive multiplayer experience.
- **Game Flow Synchronization**: Voting, elimination, and round transitions demand instantaneous updates visible to all players.
- **Avoid Polling Overhead**: Polling mechanisms would increase latency and server load, negatively impacting user experience.
- **Future-Proofing**: WebSockets provide a foundation to easily add more interactive features (e.g., chat and timers).

### **Final Decision**
We have decided to implement **WebSockets** with Socket.IO to solve the critical problem of real-time state synchronization in the **Incognito Game**. Despite the additional complexity, this technology is essential to delivering a responsive, engaging multiplayer experience and is well-aligned with our future feature roadmap.
