# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)  
## Title: Use Jest and Supertest for Unit and Integration Testing  

### Context  
For the Incognito Game backend, we require reliable testing frameworks to ensure code quality, correctness, and maintainability. The codebase includes API endpoints and internal game logic that need both unit and integration testing. After evaluating multiple testing tools and approaches, we chose to adopt Jest for unit testing and Supertest for integration testing.  

### Decision  
We will used Jest as the primary testing framework for unit tests, and Supertest to perform integration tests on the API endpoints. This combined approach balances ease of use and efficient test execution.  

### Advantages  
- **All-in-One Testing Solution (Jest):** Provides a simple, zero-configuration setup with built-in assertions, mocking, coverage reports, and snapshot testing.  
- **Fast and Reliable Unit Tests:** Jest runs tests concurrently and isolates modules for speed and consistency.  
- **Supertest for HTTP Integration:** Allows testing Express routes and API endpoints by making real HTTP requests against the server in a controlled environment.  
- **Readable Syntax:** Both Jest and Supertest have clear, expressive APIs that improve test readability and maintainability.  
- **Rich Ecosystem:** Jest is widely adopted in the JavaScript community, ensuring active support and extensive documentation.  
- **Good Developer Experience:** Integrated watch mode and detailed error reporting speed up the development workflow.  
- **Seamless Integration:** Supertest works smoothly with Jest, allowing integration tests to be written alongside unit tests without additional frameworks.  

### Disadvantages  
- **Resource Overhead:** Running integration tests with Supertest can be slower compared to pure unit tests due to starting the server and handling HTTP requests.  
- **Learning Curve:** Developers unfamiliar with Jest or Supertest needed some time to learn best practices, especially around asynchronous testing and mocking.  
- **Limited for End-to-End:** Jest and Supertest focus on backend and API testing but do not cover full end-to-end UI testing, which requires separate tools.  

### Why Not Use Other Testing Frameworks?  
- **Mocha/Chai:** Requires more manual setup and configuration, increasing initial development effort.  
- **Jasmine:** Less popular currently, with fewer updates and a smaller community compared to Jest.  
- **Superagent or Axios:** These libraries test HTTP requests but lack the integrated testing and assertion features of Supertest combined with Jest.  
- **End-to-End Tools (e.g., Cypress, Puppeteer):** These are overkill for backend API testing and introduce complexity unsuitable for unit/integration scope.  

### Final Decision  
We adopt Jest as the unit test framework and Supertest for integration testing of API endpoints to ensure robust, maintainable, and efficient test coverage for the Incognito Game backend. This choice balances developer productivity and testing effectiveness aligned with current project needs and future scalability.
