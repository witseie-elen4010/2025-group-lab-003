# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)  
## Title: Use bcrypt for Password Hashing and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Authentication  

### Context  
To securely manage user authentication in the Incognito Game backend, we need to store user passwords safely and authenticate users efficiently. Plaintext passwords pose a severe security risk. After evaluating available encryption and authentication libraries, we chose to use **bcrypt** for password hashing and **jsonwebtoken (JWT)** for token-based authentication.

### Decision  
We will use the `bcrypt` library to hash and verify user passwords securely. For session management and authentication, we will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) signed with a secret key configured via environment variables.

### Advantages  
- **Strong Password Security (bcrypt):** bcrypt applies a slow hashing algorithm with salting, making brute-force and rainbow table attacks infeasible.  
- **Widely Trusted and Tested:** bcrypt is a well-established cryptographic hashing library for passwords.  
- **Simple API:** Easy to use async functions for hashing and verifying passwords.  
- **Token-Based Authentication (JWT):** JWT allows stateless, scalable authentication without server-side session storage.  
- **Configurable Secret:** JWT secret key stored securely in environment variables, supporting secure deployment.  
- **Flexible Payload:** JWT tokens can embed user identity and roles, enabling role-based access control if needed.  
- **Standardized and Interoperable:** JWT is a widely adopted standard supported by many platforms and libraries.

### Disadvantages  
- **Computational Cost:** bcrypt hashing is intentionally slow; it increases CPU usage, which may affect performance under high load.  
- **Token Revocation Complexity:** JWT tokens, once issued, cannot be revoked easily without additional mechanisms (e.g., token blacklists).  
- **Secret Management:** Proper protection and rotation of JWT secret keys are critical to prevent token forgery.  
- **No Built-in Session Management:** Stateless JWT requires additional logic to handle logout or token expiry scenarios gracefully.

### Why Not Use Other Encryption Methods?  
- **SHA or MD5 Hashing:** These are fast, general-purpose hash functions unsuited for password storage due to vulnerability to brute force attacks.  
- **Custom Encryption:** Reinventing cryptographic methods risks introducing vulnerabilities and is not recommended.  
- **Session-Based Authentication:** Would require server-side session stores, adding complexity and scaling challenges.  

### Final Decision  
We adopt bcrypt for secure password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication in the Incognito Game backend. This approach provides a secure, scalable, and standard authentication mechanism aligned with best practices in web application security.
