# Sprint 1 Retrospective

## Overview

In Sprint 1, the goal was to implement the basic functionality for the **Incognito Game**. The main user stories were:
1. **Create Game**: A feature that allows the game creator to initiate a new game and receive a game code.
2. **Join Game**: A feature that allows players to join an existing game using a game code.
3. **Word View**: A feature that allows players to view the word they have been assigned
4. **Vote Out**: A feature that allows players to vote out a player they desire
5. **Game Results**: A feature that allows players to view the game winner after the first round

While the team successfully completed the **Create Game** and **Join Game** features, the team was unable to finish the other user stories planned for this sprint. This was primarily due to **overestimation** of the tasks and **poor time management**.

## What Was Completed

### 1. **Create Game**
   - The team successfully implemented the functionality for creating a new game. This feature generates a unique **game code** and displays game code.
   - The backend and frontend were properly integrated, allowing the game creator to initiate the game and receive a confirmation with the **game code**.
   
### 2. **Join Game**
   - The **Join Game** functionality was implemented successfully. Players are able to enter their **game code**, which is then verified in the backend. If valid, they are added to the game.


## Reasons for Failure

The inability to complete the full scope of Sprint 1 was due to several key factors:

1. **Overestimation of Task Complexity**:
   - The team underestimated the amount of work required for each feature. Some tasks, such as the **Join Game** and **Create Game** features, took longer to implement than anticipated. The team did not account for unexpected challenges such as debugging integration issues with between the frontend, backend and microsoft SQL database.

2. **Poor Time Management**:
   - The team struggled with managing time effectively. The team juggled multiple submissions in one week which led to a realignment in sprint prioritisation.

## Areas for Improvement

To improve in the future, the team should focus on the following areas:

### 1. **Better Task Estimation**:
   - The team should spend more time breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable pieces. Each task should have a clear estimate of the time required, the team should ensure that the sprint scope is achievable based on the teamâ€™s capacity.

### 2. **Prioritize Features**:
   - The team should prioritize the user stories and focus on the core functionality first. This will help ensure that the most important features are completed on time, and any additional features can be tackled in future sprints if time allows.

### 3. **Improved Time Management**:
   - Implement **daily stand-up meetings** to keep track of progress and address any blockers immediately. This will help keep everyone on track and reduce delays in completing tasks.
   
### 4. **Review Sprint Progress Regularly**:
   - At the halfway point of the sprint, the team should hold a review meeting to assess progress, identify bottlenecks, and adjust priorities if necessary.

### Conclusion

While Sprint 1 was not fully successful in completing all user stories, the team did manage to implement the **Create Game** and **Join Game** functionality. Moving forward, the team will address the incomplete tasks from **Sprint 1** for improvement and ensure that future sprints are better planned and executed.
