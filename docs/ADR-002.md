# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: Use SQL Database for Storing Game State

### **Context**
Initially, for the **Incognito Game**, we used an in-memory **`gameState` array** to manage the game state due to its simplicity and speed. However, as we scale the project and require persistent game state across server restarts, we decided to transition to a **SQL database**.

### **Decision**
We will now use an **SQL database** for storing and managing the game state persistently.

### **Advantages**
- **Persistence**: Game state is stored permanently in the database and can persist across server restarts.
- **ACID Compliance**: The database ensures reliable transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability (ACID) properties.
- **Familiarity**: The team is familiar with SQL and can easily write and optimize queries.
- **Scalability**: SQL databases can handle more concurrent games and players, making the system more robust and scalable.
- **Complex Queries**: Allows us to perform complex queries on game data (e.g., fetching player states, game history).
- **Backup and Recovery**: Database provides built-in mechanisms for backup and recovery of game data.

### **Disadvantages**
- **Slower Development**: Setting up and maintaining a SQL database introduces overhead.
- **Increased Complexity**: Database schema design, migrations, and queries require additional planning.
- **Potential Latency**: Accessing data from a database may incur higher latency compared to in-memory storage.

### **Why Switch to SQL Now?**
- **Persistence**: We need game state to be persistent across server restarts.
- **Scalability**: The in-memory solution will not scale well as the number of games and players increases.
- **Data Management**: Complex queries and relationships between players, games, and other entities are better managed with a database.

### **Future Considerations**
- **Optimizing Queries**: As the game grows, we may need to optimize SQL queries for performance, especially as we have more players and games.
- **Database Indexing**: For better performance in querying, especially with larger datasets, we will need to index columns like `gameCode` and `userId`.
- **Migration**: We'll need to plan for database migrations as the schema evolves, especially if new features or data models are added to the game.
- **Monitoring**: As the database grows, we'll need to monitor its performance and ensure it meets the needs of the application.

### **Final Decision**
We are transitioning to a **SQL database** for managing game state persistently, ensuring **scalability**, **reliability**, and **data integrity**. This solution will allow us to grow the application and handle complex game management queries more effectively.
