# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## Title: Use In-Memory `gameState` Array Instead of SQL Database

### **Context**
For the **Incognito Game**, we considered using an **SQL database** for storing game state persistently. After evaluating the trade-offs, we decided to use an in-memory **`gameState` array** for now.

### **Decision**
We will use the **in-memory `gameState` array** instead of a SQL database for managing the game state.

### **Advantages**
- **Simplicity**: Faster development with no need for a database setup.
- **No Dependencies**: Avoids the complexity of database configurations.
- **Speed**: Quick iterations on game logic.
  
### **Disadvantages**
- **No Persistence**: Game state is lost when the server restarts.
- **Scalability Issues**: May not scale well for larger games or more players.

### **Why Not Use a SQL Database Now?**
- **Simplicity**: The game logic is simple and doesn't need the features of a database.
- **Faster Development**: Avoids over-engineering and speeds up development.

### **Future Considerations**
- **Persistence**: We will switch to a database when persistence across restarts is required.
- **Scaling**: A database will be needed as the number of concurrent games increases.
- **Complex Queries**: A database will be needed for complex game data management.

### **Final Decision**
Continue with the **in-memory `gameState` array** for simplicity. Transition to a database when scaling or persistence becomes necessary.
